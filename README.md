## ⚙️ **Key Components**

### **1. Ansible**
- Automates tasks such as:
  - Deploying Kubernetes manifests.
  - Managing cluster configurations.
  - Cleaning up deployments.
- Playbooks included to simplify repetitive actions and ensure a consistent infrastructure state.

### **2. Docker**
- Contains Docker configurations and files.
- Used for building containerized applications and services.

### **3. Kubernetes Deployment**
- Contains all Kubernetes manifest files (YAML).
- Covers:
  - Deployments
  - Services
- Ensures seamless application deployment in a Kubernetes cluster.

### **4. Prometheus**
- Prometheus setup files for monitoring Kubernetes clusters and application metrics.
- Includes:
  - Prometheus configuration (prometheus.yml)
  - Rules for alerting and monitoring resource usage.

### **5. Grafana**
- Configuration files for Grafana dashboards.
- Provides visual monitoring and insights for:
  - Application metrics
  - Cluster health
  - Infrastructure performance

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **Ansible**: For automation.
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **kubectl**: For Kubernetes cluster management.
- **Prometheus** and **Grafana**: For monitoring and visualization.

### **Setup Steps**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KaramMajdi7/KubeDevOps.git
   cd KubeDevOps
   ```

2. **Run Ansible Playbooks**:
   Navigate to the `Ansible` folder and run the required playbook.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ansible.yml
   ```

3. **Deploy Kubernetes Manifests**:
   Apply the manifests in the `Kubernetes Deployment` folder:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f Deployment.yml
   kubectl apply -f Service.yml
   ```

4. **Setup Prometheus and Grafana**:
   - Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using the configurations in their respective folders.
   - Access Grafana and import dashboards for visualization.

## 📊 **Monitoring and Visualization**
1. **Prometheus**:
   - Monitors application and infrastructure metrics.
   - Integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes.

2. **Grafana**:
   - Visualizes metrics collected by Prometheus.
   - Pre-configured dashboards available for monitoring Kubernetes performance.

---

## 💡 **Future Enhancements**
- Add more Kubernetes automation roles.
- Integrate alerting mechanisms with Slack or email.
- Improve monitoring with custom Grafana dashboards.
